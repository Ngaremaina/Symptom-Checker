# Symptom-Checker
 
The symptom checker is a program that predicts the illness that the patient may be suffering from based on the symptoms provided. It directs you to the precautions you can take to control the illness. The symptoms are addressed in a yes or no format within a Streamlit form that is submitted to the app. The application is available using the link: https://symptom-checker-k4x5.onrender.com/.
