# Symptom-Checker
 
The symptom checker is a program that predicts the illness that the patient may be suffering from based on the symptoms provided. It directs you to the precautions that must be taken in order to control the illness. The symptoms are presented in a yes or no format within a Streamlit form that is submitted to the app.
